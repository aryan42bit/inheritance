Aim
To understand and implement various types of inheritance in C++ .

Theory
Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

Key Concepts
Base Class: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.
Derived Class: The class that inherits from the base class.
Access Specifiers: Control the access level of the base class members in the derived class. These include:
public: Members are accessible from outside the class.
protected: Members are accessible within the class and by derived classes.
private: Members are accessible only within the class.
Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class is derived from another derived class.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes are derived from a single base class.
Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
